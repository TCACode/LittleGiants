We are making the website for a local author in Jackson, TN Niles Reddick
I choose the color that blended well with background image. The color for the buttons fit well with the website image. 
Researched the author, and found photos of him to us as the background. Knowing the author’s desire was to advertise and sale his books, buttons were created as an important part of the site map. In the content review, we reviewed the author’s current website as well as other author’s websites. In the design phase, an overview of the website with the author was done to discuss the color, typography, and imagery. We wanted to create a website that lets you get know some of Niles' work and who he is. So we added some stories from his books and just some general information of who he is.
we chose blue for a lot of the buttons and other colors because it is associated with the main colors of the school Niles works at.
